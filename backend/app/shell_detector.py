shell_detector.py – Detect layered shell account networks.

Definition
----------
A shell chain is a directed path of length SHELL_MIN_CHAIN to SHELL_MAX_CHAIN
hops where ALL intermediate nodes (everything except source and destination)
are "pass-through shell" accounts — low-activity nodes used purely to add
layers of obfuscation.

Pass-through shell criteria
----------------------------
A node is a shell intermediary if ALL of the following hold:
  1. tx_count ≤ SHELL_MAX_TX  (very few transactions — kept dormant)
  2. in_degree > 0             (receives money)
  3. out_degree > 0            (forwards money — pure pass-through, not a dead end)
  4. NOT in any strongly-connected component of size > 1.
     Nodes in SCCs are participants in cycles, not pass-through shells.
     This prevents cycle nodes (A1→A2→A3→A1) from being misclassified as shells.

Source and destination nodes have no special tx_count requirements — they are
simply the first and last nodes of the discovered chain.

Algorithm
---------
Iterative DFS that starts from every node with at least one successor that
qualifies as a shell intermediary.  Explores through the shell subgraph and
terminates (potentially recording a chain) whenever it reaches a non-shell node
or exhausts extension depth.

Hard cap MAX_SHELL_CHAINS prevents excessive output.
