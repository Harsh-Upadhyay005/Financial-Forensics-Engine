smurf_detector.py – Detect smurfing patterns (fan-in / fan-out).

Smurfing (structuring)
-----------------------
  Fan-in  : FAN_THRESHOLD+ unique senders → 1 receiver within a 72-hour window.
  Fan-out : 1 sender → FAN_THRESHOLD+ unique receivers within a 72-hour window.

False-positive control (semantic approach)
------------------------------------------
Rather than percentile-based exclusion (which breaks on small datasets where
legitimate merchants and mule aggregators have the same transaction count),
we use two semantic signals:

  Fan-in exclusion — MERCHANT pattern:
    Retail merchants receive payments of VARIABLE amounts from many customers.
    Smurfing aggregators receive UNIFORM small deposits from many sources.
    If the coefficient of variation (std/mean) of a receiver's incoming amounts
    exceeds MERCHANT_AMOUNT_CV_THRESHOLD → treat as legitimate merchant → exclude
    from fan-in rings (will NOT be flagged).

  Fan-out exclusion — PAYROLL BATCH pattern:
    Corporate payroll systems push all salary transactions simultaneously
    (within seconds of each other as a single batch job).
    Smurfing dispersers stagger their sends over minutes/hours to stay below
    reporting thresholds.
    If ALL outgoing transactions from a sender occur within PAYROLL_BATCH_SECONDS
    of each other → treat as payroll batch → exclude from fan-out rings.

Performance
-----------
Two-pointer sliding window: O(n) per group instead of O(n²).
